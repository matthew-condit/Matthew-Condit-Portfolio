          h2 Colgate Dischords
          p In 2014, I designed the Colgate Dischords website.  This a cappella group meant a lot to me during my time at Colgate, so I still update it as frequently as possible.  It was built with the Content Management System Weebly.

          h2 My 404 Page
          p Hopefully you haven't hit this page yet and all the links are working!  A unique and helpful 404 page can immensely enhance the user experience, and it gives me some practice in photoshop (and paint.net).  I'll be redesigning this page periodically to reflect the season!
