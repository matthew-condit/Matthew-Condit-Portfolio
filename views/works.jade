          h2 Colgate Dischords
          p In 2014, I designed the Colgate Dischords website.  This a cappella group meant a lot to me during my time at Colgate, so I still update it as frequently as possible.  It was built with the Content Management System Weebly.

          h2 My 404 Page
          p Hopefully you haven't hit this page yet and all the links are working!  A unique and helpful 404 page can immensely enhance the user experience, and it gave me some practice in photoshop (and paint.net).  I'll be redesigning this page periodically to reflect the season!

          p To demonstrate some proficiency in different design priciples and my current personal philosophies on front end design, I created this design page.  It will often times have more recent designs of mine (compared to this site as a whole) as well as some experimental snippets as well.
