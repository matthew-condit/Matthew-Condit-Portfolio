        p In 2013, I wrote my first line of code.
        code print("Hello, world!")
        p I thought I was the next Bill Gates (I'm still hoping I might have been right!)
        p That was the moment my passion for programming started, and I didn't stop there.

        p Over the course of the next few years, I learned computer science and theory at Colgate University.  Most importantly, however, I gained social and communication experience and a diverse background in the arts to complement my technical knowledge.

        p While at Colgate, I found a passion for A Cappella.  It doesn't have anything to do with being a developer, but the Colgate Dischords were a big part of my life. It led me to join a post-collegiate A Cappella group in Boston called Collective Measures!

        p After stumbling upon the wonderful world of programming, it feels like I've had a taste of about every possible aspect of programming possible.  I've learned quite a few different languages, from MIPS assembly language to haskell to javascript.  I really haven't stopped learning since I wrote that first line of Python, and I don't think that will change any time soon.
