      h1 About Me
      p  I'm Matt Condit, and I'm a full-stack web developer in Somerville, Massachusetts.  I'm an avid coder, as well musician, hiker, and friend. 
      p  Starting off in a Computer Science program at Colgate University, I learned the basics of programming.  This time at Colgate allowed me to develop a great theoretical foundation for web development. 
      p  After taking summer jobs at ModusBox and Flatiron Schools, I started to realize a passion for web development.  It seemed like such a phenomenal platform for programming in a creative environment.  Even though my school didn't teach any web development, I began studying front-end design and web frameworks and soon knew that web development was for me. 
      p  Fast forward to present day and I haven't stopped learning anything I can get my hands on.  I hope this feeling doesn't stop, because it's my avid desire to learn that drives my quick development.

          p After two semesters in the Computer Science program at Colgate, I was hooked.  I knew it would be my major, and I couldn't wait to learn more.  Unfortunately, after only doing it for a year, I didn't know where to start.

          p My first summer of college, I was jobless.  I had very little experience in programming, but I didn't want to do anything else for the summer.  I also was too naive to realize that I didn't need a job in programming to learn more, a critically important lesson to learn.

            | Thankfully, 
            a(href='http://www.modusbox.com/') ModusBox 
            | took me under their wing during my first summer job hunt and let me be their Java Development Intern.  
            | They were a young startup at the time, and almost all of the technology that we used was foreign to me at the time, but I learned as fast as possible to do what I could for the project. It was my first experience of what programming and web development could actually be like, and it was a lot of learning.  I loved it.

            | A year later, I found myself teaching at 
            a(href='https://flatironschool.com/') Flatiron Schools in Boston 
            | where, as a Summer Program Assistant, I aided in the web development education of over 50 middle school and high school students. 
            | In a two week bootcamp, students would learn the basics of programming.
            | They advanced up through more complex programming, HTML and CSS lessons, all the way to a full Ruby-on-Rails application.  Being able to instill the passion for programming in my students that I saw was inspiring, and is a reminder that every day of coding should be as fun as that first "Hello World!".

          time Now 
          p Currently, I'm working full-time as a Web Application Developer at Toxikon Corporation, primarily focusing on ASP.NET MVC Development.  I'm in the process of making the change to a MEAN Stack for any applications that the stack fits.  I'm a lone developer at a 200+ person pre-clinical pharmaceutical testing company, and it is definitely a unique expereience.  I teach myself something new every day, and hope to continue that trend into the future
